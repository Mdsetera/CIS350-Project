General:
-dealer starts at seat 0, small blind at seat 1 and big blind at seat 2
-hands continue until only one player has chips (self.checkEndGame)
-blinds increase every five rounds
-the amount of winnings a player is eligible for is based on how much they are able to bet
if a player goes "all in", they are only eligible for the amount they bet, and the amount that other players match
any bets over what that player bet, they are not eligible for

First round of Betting:
-all bets must be a multiple of five (easier math)
-play starts to the left of the big blind
-raises must be at least double the big blind
